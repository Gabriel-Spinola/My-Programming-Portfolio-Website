# WebSite With Bootstrap
 A website created with Bootstrap PHP and jQuery.
 
 the website front-end was created based on a Danki Code course project.
 All the code is free to use and modify. If you have a tip I would be very grateful to receive it, especially for my English.

 Due to a jquery bug, the "attr" function always returning undefined, so a part of the javascript code seems poorly optimized.
