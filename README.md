# My Programming Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my programming portfolio website. This website is a showcase of my programming projects and serves as a digital portfolio for my lecture on Senaimg Ctti.

## About

This website is designed to provide an overview of my programming journey and the projects I've worked on. It's intended to be a resource for anyone interested in exploring my programming skills, experiences, and contributions.

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: Browse through a collection of my programming projects, each with a description and links to the source code or live demos.

- **Lecture Materials**: Find resources related to my lecture on Senaimg Ctti, including presentation slides and supplementary materials.

- **Contact Information**: Reach out to me if you have questions or want to connect. You can find my contact information on the website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: The website is built using HTML and CSS to create a clean and responsive design.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for interactivity and animations on the website.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is utilized for styling and layout components.

- **PHP and SQL**: I've also integrated PHP and SQL for dynamic content and data management.

## Approach

I've tried to keep this website simple and use mostly vanilla technologies to provide a straightforward and fast development. My goal is to showcase my programming skills without overcomplicating the technology stack, considering that I had a strict timeline to develop the project.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as an archive for the website's source code, contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome. If you have ideas to enhance the website or correct issues, please feel free to open a pull request.

## Future Plans

I intend to continue working on this repository
