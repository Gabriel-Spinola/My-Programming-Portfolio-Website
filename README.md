# WebSite With Bootstrap

 ### About the Project
A website I created to practice Bootstrap and PHP.
If you have some feedback, I would be very grateful to receive them, especially for my English.

 ### How to run in your pc
  you need to use the MySql database ([you can download mine here](https://github.com/Gabriel-Spinola/Website-With-Bootstrap/blob/main/DataBase/bootstrap_project.sql)),<br>
  the [JQuery Lib](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

 ### Extra
 
 Due to a jquery bug, the "attr" function always returning undefined, so a part of the javascript code seems poorly optimized.
